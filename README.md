# Distance Matrix Example

When it came time to do taxes, my wife who is a realtor, had a long list of showings she had taken clients to in the past year but we had not written any of the mileage down as we went. I thought this would be a good chance to mess with the Google APIs and came across the Distance Matrix API.

## Directions
* Go through Googles process to obtain an API key
* Create a config.py file with your API key stored in a variable inside
* Create a .gitignore file to hide your config.py and your API key

TODO:
* Document the example better.
* Try to improve speed and output.
* Finish the directions
