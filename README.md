# Distance Matrix Example

When it came time to do taxes, my wife who is a realtor, had a long list of showings she had taken clients to in the past year but we had not written any of the mileage down as we went. I thought this would be a good chance to mess with the Google APIs and came across the Distance Matrix API.

TODO:
* Document the example better.
* Try to improve speed and output.
